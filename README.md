# EE371Q-Ocular-Disease-Deep-Learning
Deep learning on ocular fundus images to detect disease
This project creates convolutional neural networks to detect diseases on fundus images of eyes. 
The primary source of data is from the ODIR-5K dataset, though additional images were sourced elsewhere.
Additional sources are described in the notebooks above.
